One option is to clearly indicate the action of the step by using\nthe {verb} + {noun} content formula. For example, \"Configure IdP\" or \"Define\nendpoints.\" A label may use one word if it is universally understood, such as\n\"Cart,\" \"Shipping,\" or \"Payment.\" Avoid vague terms like \"Processing.\" You may\nalso number each step to make the progression more obvious.\n\n#### Helper text\n\nUse the helper text to indicate that a step is optional or that a step is in an\nerror state.\n\n### Overflow content\n\n#### Label\n\nWhen there is not enough space, consider rewording the label or truncate the\nlabel text with an ellipsis and provide a tooltip to convey additional\ninformation.\n\n#### Helper text\n\nLong helper text may wrap to a second line, and this is preferable to\ntruncation.

View the\n[Style](/components/progress-indicator/style/) tab for visual specs of each\nstate and see the\n[status indicator pattern](/patterns/status-indicator-pattern/) for additional\nguidance.\n\n| State       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Completed   | A step is complete when a user has filled out the required information within a step and progressed to the following step. When possible, use validation to confirm that a step has been completed before the user continues. All steps that have been completed are indicated by an outlined circle with a checkmark and a blue active line. |\n| Current     | A step is current when a user is interacting with the information within that step. The current step the user is on is indicated by a half-filled circle and a blue active line.                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Not started | A step is not started when a user has not yet interacted with that step. Steps the user has not encountered yet, or future steps, are indicated by an outlined circle and a gray active line.                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Error       | A step may be in error when a user has entered invalid or incomplete information. There could also be a server-side error. Provide clear information about the error and guidance on how to resolve the issue.                                                                                                                                |\n| Disabled    | A step is disabled when all interactive functions have been removed. Unlike read-only states, disabled states are not focusable, are not read by screen readers, and do not need to pass visual contrast, making them inaccessible if they need to be interpreted.                                                                            |\n| Hover       | Use the hover state when a user's mouse cursor is hovering over the progress indicator's step.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Focus       | When a user tabs to or clicks on the progress indicator's step, the step becomes focused, indicating the user has successfully navigated to the component.                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n\n### Interactions\n\nBy default, the progress indicator is not interactive, providing only a visual\nupdate of the users' progress. There is also an option for an interactive\nprogress indicator, which allows users to navigate to each step.\n\n#### Mouse\n\nIf the progress indicator is interactive, users can navigate to a step by\nclicking anywhere within the step label container.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Example of an interactive progress indicator](images/progress-indicator-usage-6.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Keyboard\n\nThe first step should be selected by default. Users can navigate between steps\nby pressing `Right` or `Left` arrow keys. For additional keyboard interactions,\nsee the [Accessibility](/components/progress-indicator/accessibility/) tab.\n\n### Validation\n\nWhen possible, use validation to confirm that a step has been completed before\nthe user continues. If any entry is invalid, the progress indicator should show\nan error state. Additionally, the invalid entry should be marked with an error\nstate and include an inline error message that helps the user understand the\nproblem and how to fix it. This kind of inline validation (or client-side\nvalidation) should happen as soon as the field loses focus.\n\nIf the user cannot proceed due to a server-side issue, then an\n[inline notification](/components/notification/code#inline-notification) should\nappear.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Example of a progress indicator using validation](images/progress-indicator-usage-7.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Example of a progress indicator using validation.\n</Caption>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Related\n\n- The progress indicator component is commonly used in\n  [dialogs](/patterns/dialog-pattern/) or [forms](/patterns/forms-pattern/).\n- It is also common to use the progress indicator in a\n  [tearsheet](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/components/tearsheet/usage/),\n  a component provided by Carbon for IBM Products.\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"fcb7ddf217c410b3d6675591fccf2b7d","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":5005},"frontmatter":{"title":"Progress indicator","description":"A progress indicator is a visual representation of a user's progress through a set of steps, guiding toward the completion of a specified process.","tabs":["Usage","Style","Code","Accessibility"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Progress indicator\ndescription:\n  A progress indicator is a visual representation of a user's progress through a\n  set of steps, guiding toward the completion of a specified process.\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\nimport A11yStatus from 'components/A11yStatus';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nA progress indicator guides users through any linear, multistep task by showing\nthe user their completed, current, and future steps.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Live demo</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Formatting</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Content</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Behaviors</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Related</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Live demo\n\n<StorybookDemo\n  themeSelector\n  url=\"https://react.carbondesignsystem.com\"\n  variants={[\n    {\n      label: 'Default',\n      variant: 'components-progressindicator--default',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'Interactive',\n      variant: 'components-progressindicator--interactive',\n    },\n  ]}\n/>\n\n<A11yStatus layout=\"cards\" components=\"Progress indicator\" />\n\n## Overview\n\nProgress indicators help manage a user's expectations when completing a\nmultistep process.
