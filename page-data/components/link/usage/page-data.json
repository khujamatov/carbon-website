They provide a lightweight option for navigation, but like other\ninteractive elements, too many links will clutter a page and make it difficult\nfor users to identify their next steps. This is especially true for inline\nlinks, which should be used sparingly.\n\n### When to use\n\nUse links when you want users to:\n\n- Navigate to a different page within the application\n- Navigate to an entirely different site\n- Jump to an element on the same page\n- Link to emails or phone numbers\n\n### When not to use\n\nDo not use links for actions that will change data or manipulate how it is\ndisplayed, change a state, or trigger an action. Instead, use\n[buttons](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/) to guide\nusers to specific actions.\n\nDo not use images as links. Instead, use a\n[tile](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tile/usage/) that can contain\nan image and additional information such as links.\n\n### Variants\n\n| Variant                        | Usage                                                                                                        |\n| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| [Standalone](#standalone-link) | Used on their own or directly following content and do not use underlines.

There’s a change in the color token as `$link-visited`.                  |\n| Disabled            | When a user cannot interact with the link. Links could be temporarily inactive or unavailable.                                    |\n\n### Interactions\n\n#### Mouse\n\nUsers can open a link by clicking anywhere on the link text or on the associated\nicon.\n\n#### Keyboard\n\nUsers can open a link by pressing `Enter` while the link has focus. For\nadditional keyboard interactions, see the\n[Accessibility](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/link/accessibility#keyboard-interactions)\ntab.\n\n### Responsive behavior\n\nClicking or activating on a link can:\n\n- Open up a modal with read-only information\n- Navigate the user to a new page, changing the URL and causing a browser\n  refresh\n- Support jumps to different sections within the same page\n- Open web resources such as images, videos, or HTML documents\n\n### Clickable areas\n\nBoth standalone and inline links are clickable across the entire width of the\ntext. Standalone link with an icon has an expanded clickable area that includes\nthe icon.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Standalone and inline links with their clickable areas](images/link-usage-clickable.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Standalone and inline links with their clickable areas</Caption>\n\n## Standalone link\n\nStandalone links are used on their own directly following content. They should\nnot be used within sentences or paragraphs. Standalone links are the default\nlink style for Carbon and only have an underline in the hover state, focus\nstate, and active state.\n\nThe standalone link component can be paired with an icon. Icons should always be\nthe same color as the link text. When necessary, utilize appropriate icons to\ndistinguish them from ghost buttons or inline links when they appear within the\nsame context or page.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example shows the standalone link within context](images/link-usage-standalone.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example shows the standalone link within context</Caption>\n\n### Inline link\n\nInline links are used in sentences or paragraphs of text. The inline link\nbehaves the same as the standalone link but it is styled with an underline. This\nhelps differentiate them from the text they are placed next to and makes it\nclear users can interact with them.\n\nInline links should not be used on their own and should not be paired with\nicons.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example shows inline links within the body text](images/03_link_inline_608.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example shows inline links within the body text</Caption>\n\n## Modifiers\n\n### Visited style\n\nBy default, the link component does not use a visited style. Visited links\nindicate that a user has already opened the link so they can be a helpful\nindicator during task completion. Visited styles should be used sparingly\nbecause they often clutter the page and add further visual noise as users are\ntrying to navigate a product. They can be used to show users they have already\nclicked on a link if it's important.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example shows unvisited and visited links](images/link-usage-modifiers-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example shows unvisited and visited links</Caption>\n\n### Links that trigger actions\n\nSome links trigger actions to aid task completion in addition to navigation.\nThese links should still serve a navigation purpose. A common example is linking\nphone numbers, so clicking the website automatically opens and calls the phone\nnumber when clicked. The link text and any accompanying icons should clarify\nwhat action will be triggered and where the user will be directed.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example shows inline links for email](images/link-usage-modifiers-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example shows inline links for email</Caption>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont type=\"do\" caption=\"Do use links when actions navigate users to resources\">\n\n![Do use links when actions navigate users to resources](images/link-usage-modifiers-do.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not use buttons when actions serve as a navigation purpose\">\n\n![Do not use buttons when actions serve as a navigation purpose](images/link-usage-modifiers-dont.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Link grouping\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Code unavailability** The following specs are not developed for the link\ncomponent but are recommended by design as the proper distance between grouped\nlinks.
